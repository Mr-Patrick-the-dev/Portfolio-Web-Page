          <p>I am a beginning web developer with a thirst for knowledge and a want to learn from those I wish to be like. Currently residing in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, I work as a Network Support Technician at TuWay Communications. Though I love technology, I have a creative side that wants to express itself. Web development allows me to traverse both of those avenues.</p>

          <h4>What drives me to go?</h4><br>
          <ol>
            <li>I've always wanted to provide a better life for my loved ones.</li>
            <li>I have an extensive love for video games. I really enjoy the teamwork and problem-solving involved.</li>
            <li>Every morning, when I wake up, I make it a point to do better than the day before.</li>
            <li>I have an obsession with knowing how things work. Whether it's a puzzle in a video game or the intricacies behind various technology, I feel the need to know.</li>
            <li>I love the feeling I get when I conquer an almost impassable obstacle. Being able to say "I am proud of the work I've done" can't be replaced to me.</li>

          <h4>What makes the man?</h4><br>
          <ul>
            <li>I have a gaming team that I play online with. They've become family, and we play games from various genres like Monster Hunter and Madden.
            <li>I am an avid movie buff, mainly horror movies. There isn't a zombie movie in existence that I have not seen.</li>
            <li>My favorite sport would have to be American Football, with my favorite team being the Dallas Cowboys (hence the color scheme).</li>
            <li>The only thing I love more is my family, who I spend all the time that I can with.</li>
