          <hr>
          <p>I am a beginning web developer with a thirst for knowledge and a want to learn from those I wish to be like. Currently residing in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, I work as a Network Support Technician at TuWay Communications. Though I love technology, I have a creative side that wants to express itself. Web development allows me to traverse both of those avenues.</p>

          <h4>What makes the man?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I am a huge gamer. Part of the reason I began web development is because I wanted to know the code behind some of my favorite games and websites.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Team based games are where I thrive; I have learned to excel at communicating and resolving problems with my counterparts.</li>
                <li>I also love a good single-player, story driven game (like Resident Evil) where I am required to solve puzzles on my own.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>I am an avid movie buff, mainly horror movies.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There isn't a zombie movie in existence that I have not seen.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>My favorite sport would have to be American Football, with my favorite team being the Dallas Cowboys</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I have played football myself since I was about 13, at the Wide Receiver, Runningback, Safety, and Cornerback positions.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The only thing I love more is my family, who I spend all the time I can with</li>
